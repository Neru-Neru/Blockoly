# Getting Started with Docker

1. Type it at first.

   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

   Wait a minute. (In my environment, 180s is needed.)

2. You'll see that `react-scripts start` command starts.

   Wait a minute again. (In my environment, 80s is needed.)

3. After webpack compile, go to [`http://localhost:3000/`](url) .
